# Common Metadata Combine

## What is it?

Common Metadata Combine is a harvesting app for obtaining climate science data from NASA's Earthdata websites. 

## How do I use it? 
 
This app is hosted online at https://mschmele.github.io/Common-Metadata-Combine/search.html

First, go to https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov and log in.

Then, go to https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov and find data that has Online Access (a.k.a. Direct Download) and compile a text file with each HTTP link on one line. Earthdata Search should have an option to do this for you.

Lastly, go to the Combine and upload your text file. Click the "Download" button and watch the magic happen! No more cURL or wget!
